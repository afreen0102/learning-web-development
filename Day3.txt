Document Fragment:

   light weight document object.

Optimizing JavaScript Code:

understood reflow and repaint

PERFORMANCE: 
let t1 = performance.now()

THE CALL STACK:

single-threading: One Command at a time
(js is single threaded language)


function addPara() {
    let para = document.createElement('p');
    para.textContent = 'Js is Single';
    document.body.appendChild(para);
}

function appendNewMeassage() {
    let para = document.createElement('p');
    para.textContent = 'Js is Single';
    document.body.appendChild(para);   
}

addPara();
appendNewMeassage();



~ 1 hour - JavaScript optimization
~ Learned about very intresting stuff today.
  Reflow and Repaint.


  basically, reflow is a phase where re-calculations are done.(for height width margin paddind..,etc)
  and repaint is phase where the UI is displayed. 




EVENT LOOP: 

a loop between 
          * Call Stack
          * Browser
          * event Queue
